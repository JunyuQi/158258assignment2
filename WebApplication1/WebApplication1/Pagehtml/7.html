        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Given N
            Closed interval [ai,bi]
            Please choose as few points as possible on the number line, so that each interval contains at least one selected point.

            Outputs the minimum number of selected points.<br />

            Points that are located at the end of the interval are also counted as within the interval.
        </p>

        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p>
            The first row contains the integer N
            to indicate the number of intervals.<br />

            Next N
            Rows, each containing two integers ai, bi
            , representing the two endpoints of an interval.

        </p>

        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p>
            Outputs an integer representing the minimum number of points required.
