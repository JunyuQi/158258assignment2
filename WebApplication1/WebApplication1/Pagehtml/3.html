        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>
            Implement a singly linked list, the linked list is initially empty, and supports three operations:

            insert a number into the linked list header;<br />
            Delete section k the number after the number of insertions;<br />
            In k inserts a number after the inserted number.
        </p>

        <h2>Input</h2>
        <p>
            The first line contains the integer M
            to indicate the number of operations.<br />

            Next M
            Lines, each of which contains one action command, which may be one of the following types:<br />

            H x indicates the insertion of a number x into the header of the linked list<br />
            D k, which means that kth is deleted
            the number after the number of insertions (when k
            is 0
            , the head node is deleted)<br />
            I k x, which means at k
            inserts a number x after the inserted number
            (In this operation k
            are greater than 0）<br />
        </p>

        <h2>Output</h2>
        <p>
            A total row outputs the entire linked list from beginning to end.
        </p>

        <h2>Sample Input</h2>
        <pre>
            10<br />
            H 9<br />
            I 1 1<br />
            D 1<br />
            D 0<br />
            H 6<br />
            I 3 6<br />
            I 4 5<br />
            I 4 5<br />
            I 3 4<br />
            D 6
        </pre>

        <h2>Sample Output</h2>
        <pre>
            6 4 6 5
        </pre>
